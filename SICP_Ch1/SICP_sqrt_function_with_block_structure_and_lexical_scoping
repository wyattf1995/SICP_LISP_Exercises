#lang racket

;Uses lexical scoping. Meaning that the argument x that is initially passed to the
;sqrt function is also passed to all of the subprocedures that take a variable x
;This is possible because we used block structure to define the subprocedures
;inside of the sqrt procedure.

(define (sqrt x)
  (define (good-enough? guess)
    (< (abs (- (* guess guess) x)) 0.000000000000000001))
    
  (define (improve guess)
    (average guess (/ x guess)))
    
  (define (sqrt-iter guess)
    (if (good-enough? guess)
        guess
